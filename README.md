# Cloud to Moon

Browser extension that replaces occurrences of 'the cloud' with 'the moon'. Ported from [Steven Franks](http://stevenf.com)'s [Cloud to Butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt/) at the behest of [Paul Mison](https://twitter.com/blech/status/311644070273490945).

* [Direct download of Safari extension](https://github.com/benward/cloud-to-moon/blob/master/CloudToMoon.safariextz?raw=true)

## Installation

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions.  Drag CloudToMoon.crx into the page that appears.

## Changes

v1.1 - Wrap extension in closure, convert ‘in the cloud’ to ‘on the moon’, tidy up case-variance replacement.
